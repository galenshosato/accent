Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
And that so lamely and unfashionable
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity:
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
I am determined to prove a villain
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
To set my brother Clarence and the king
In deadly hate the one against the other:
And if King Edward be as true and just
As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
Clarence comes.

Well, here's a story for you: Sarah Perry was a veterinary nurse who had
been working daily at an old zoo in a deserted district of the territory, so she
was very happy to start a new job at a superb private practice in North
Square near the Duke Street Tower. That area was much nearer for her and
more to her liking. Even so, on her first morning, she felt stressed. She ate a
bowl of porridge, checked herself in the mirror and washed her face in a
hurry. Then she put on a plain yellow dress and a fleece jacket, picked up
her kit and headed for work.

When she got there, there was a woman with a goose waiting for her. The
woman gave Sarah an official letter from the vet. The letter implied that the
animal could be suffering from a rare form of foot and mouth disease, which
was surprising, because normally you would only expect to see it in a dog or
a goat. Sarah was sentimental, so this made her feel sorry for the beautiful
bird.

Before long, that itchy goose began to strut around the office like a lunatic,
which made an unsanitary mess. The goose's owner, Mary Harrison, kept
calling, "Comma, Comma," which Sarah thought was an odd choice for a
name. Comma was strong and huge, so it would take some force to trap her,
but Sarah had a different idea. First she tried gently stroking the goose's
lower back with her palm, then singing a tune to her. Finally, she
administered ether. Her efforts were not futile. In no time, the goose began
to tire, so Sarah was able to hold onto Comma and give her a relaxing bath.

Once Sarah had managed to bathe the goose, she wiped her off with a cloth
and laid her on her right side. Then Sarah confirmed the vet's diagnosis.
Almost immediately, she remembered an effective treatment that required
her to measure out a lot of medicine. Sarah warned that this course of
treatment might be expensive—either five or six times the cost of penicillin.
I can't imagine paying so much, but Mrs. Harrison—a millionaire lawyer—
thought it was a fair price for a cure.

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a 
new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men 
are created equal. “Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that 
nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met 
on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that 
field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation 
might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. “But in a 
larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. 
The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it, far above our 
poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember, what we 
say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, 
to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so
nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before 
us,that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which 
they gave the last full measure of devotion, that we here highly resolve that 
these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have a 
new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the 
people, shall not perish from the earth.

To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause: there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of Time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.-Soft you now!
